        <h1 class="heading">Hey, Video Game Nerdy is Cool Too!</h1>
        <p>I'm such a video game nerd, it's not even funny! I still remember my dad waiting in line at Toy's R Us to
            get the original NES console that had the Super Mario Bros./Duck Hunt package and the Zapper gun. Man,
            were those ever the days!</p>
        <p>Growing up, I loved playing games at the arcade. Some of my arcade favorites when I was 10-14 years old
            were the Street Fighter games (including the Marvel vs. Capcom series), the Mortal Kombat series, X-Men
            (that big 6-player cabinet was pretty gnarly), The Simpsons 4-player cabinet, and any of the TMNT
            4-player games! My piggy bank was always empty when I was younger.</p>
        <p>I loved arcade games so much when I was younger, I figured out how to play all of my favorite ones on
            emulators. Basically emulators are software programs that mimic the hardware of the console (or arcade
            cabinet) you want to play and you can play those games on your computer if you have the game files.
            There was even emulators that had a plugin that enabled online play, so you could compete worldwide to
            exert your Street Fighter dominance!</p>
