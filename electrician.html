                <p>I can't believe it's been over 20 years since I started working in the trade!  I feel really blessed that electrical has allowed me a decent living over the years.</p>
                <p>In Washington state, we have different licenses for different types of electrical workers.  I have an 01 License which allows me to work on any type of installation, from apartments and houses to commercial and industrial buildings.</p>
                <p>Indeed I have worked on many different projects.  I have also had the privilege of running work as a foreman.  I ran a small boathouse job in Kenmore, a lighting retrofit project for a nursing home facility locally in Bremerton, even a small piece of the Sound Transit Light Rail that goes from Seattle to Bellevue!  I was extremely proud to help install the electrical for some special roll up doors at Sea-Tac Airport.</p>

                <p>After giving God the credit for the ability to do this job, I also want to give a shout out to my union <a href="https://ibew46.com" target="_blank">IBEW Local 46 </a>for finding good work for the membership and <a href="https://www.psejatc.org" target="_blank">Puget Sound Electrical Apprenticeship </a>for the excellent training!</p>
