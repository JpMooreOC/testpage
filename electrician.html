            <p>I can't believe it's been over 20 years since I started working in the trade! I feel really blessed that
                electrical has allowed me a decent living over the years.</p>
            <p>In Washington state, we have different licenses for different types of electrical workers. I have an 01
                License which allows me to work on any type of installation, from apartments and houses to commercial
                and industrial buildings.</p>
            <p>Indeed I have worked on many different projects. I have also had the privilege of running work as a
                foreman. I ran a small boathouse job in Kenmore, a lighting retrofit project for a nursing home facility
                locally in Bremerton, even a small piece of the Sound Transit Light Rail that goes from Seattle to
                Bellevue! I was extremely proud to help install the electrical for some special roll up doors at Sea-Tac
                Airport.</p>
            <img src="elec2.jpg" alt="light rail project">
            <p>After giving God the credit for the ability to do this job, I also want to give a shout out to my union
                <a href="https://ibew46.com" target="_blank">IBEW Local 46 </a>for finding good work for the membership
                and <a href="https://www.psejatc.org" target="_blank">Puget Sound Electrical Apprenticeship </a>for the
                excellent training!</p>
