        <h1 class="heading">Yep, I'm a Working Dude</h1>
        <p>I can't believe it's been over 20 years since I started working in the trade! I feel really blessed that
            electrical has allowed me a decent living over the years.</p>
        <p>In Washington state, we have different licenses for different types of electrical workers. I have an 01
            License which allows me to work on any type of installation, from apartments and houses to commercial
            and industrial buildings.</p>
        <p>Indeed I have worked on many different projects. I have also had the privilege of running work as a
            foreman. I ran a small boathouse job in Kenmore, a lighting retrofit project for a nursing home facility
            locally in Bremerton, even a small piece of the Sound Transit Light Rail that goes from Seattle to
            Bellevue! I was extremely proud to help install the electrical for some special roll up doors at Sea-Tac
            Airport.</p>
        <p>After giving God the credit for the ability to do this job, I also want to give a shout out to my union
            <a href="https://ibew46.com" target="_blank">IBEW Local 46 </a>for finding good work for the membership
            and the <a href="https://www.psejatc.org" target="_blank">Puget Sound Electrical Apprenticeship</a> for the
            excellent training!
        </p>
        <p>"So why go back to school in computers," you may be thinking. I really want to get more skills in other
            things so I don't have to be busting my hump slanging the tools in my 50's and 60's!</p>
