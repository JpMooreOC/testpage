        <h1 class="heading">My Picks For Top TV Shows and Movies</h1>
        <p>Before I begin, I just wanted to note that these are the official top TV shows and movies. The list isn't
            wrong; just YOU if you disagree (just kidding, sort of haha).</p>
        <p>I know it might seem irrelevant, but when I was kid, it was all about most of the classic Nickolodeon
            cartoons, Inspector Gadget, Transformers, and of course the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Since
            I've definitely revealed myself to be an 80's/90's kid, this was definitely the best era for children's
            cartoons.</p>
        <p>Now that I'm older I'd like to think anyway that my tastes have matured. I like historical shows like
            Spartacus (with Andy Whitfield as Spartacus), or drama shows that are well-written with lots of conflict
            and suspense like Breaking Bad. Breaking Bad might be the best show ever made, with Better Call Saul,
            its prequel, being pretty good as well. I did think at one point Game of Thrones was pretty good, but by
            at least season 6 it was starting to tank and certainly the ending (basically the whole last season) was
            a "Lost" level sort of legendary terrible way to end it.</p>
        <p>So what about Movies? As far as the best performance in a movie, I would have to say that Heath Ledger's
            performance as the Joker in the Dark Knight might be the best performance in any movie, and definitely
            made the Dark Knight the best Batman movie. The best movie series is the Godfather (especially the 1st
            and 2nd one), which are truly masterpieces. And there ya have it.</p>
