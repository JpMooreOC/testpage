                <img src="crab1.jpg" alt="pot" class="articlepic">
                <p>Crabs are really fun to catch, and it's a very good way to kill some time on a weekend.  You can catch crabs with a variety of traps.  There are crab snares (which attach to fishing poles), collapsible crab rings, castable crab traps (which attach to a heavy duty fishing pole and line), and crab pots.  The favorites for us are castable traps and crab pots.</p>
                <p>The castable traps and the crab pots are the only traps we use!  They've been the most successful in catching crabs we then use for dinner. Castables are nice because they allow you to start trapping in a lot of different areas (like off a dock) where you can cast further than people who just use pots.</p>
                <p>Crab pots are great because you can set them to sit for a good while (like 2 hours if you're crabbing at a dock) and then just wait for the dinner to start coming into the trap!  I've had it be super heavy trying to pull up a mountain of crabs!</p>

                <p>Some of the wonderful things we like to make with our catch is: your standard seafood boil, crab alfredo, dungeness melts, and crab ravioli!</p>
